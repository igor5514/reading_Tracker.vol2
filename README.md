#  Reading Tracker 2.0 by Kenzin Igor

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own assignment details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
I started on 05/20/2021 at 3:36 pm SG time.
As a result, I finished on the 30th at 12:17 am Singapore time.
In total, it took a little less than 10 days. But I think I could finish faster if I didn't work in parallel

  

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I am satisfied with all the experience that I received. This work made it clear that in programming it is possible to create almost anything so that the user can comfortably use it.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
Most likely this is a visualization. To be honest, it was very difficult for me, because the words were constantly moving somewhere, the squares were not the right size and the like.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
My knowledge gained during the semester worked best. Hard work gives its results and it was not super difficult to cope with this work, but still there were some problems.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Most likely, it will be necessary to improve the amount of my time)) Because of my work, I could not devote all 100% of my time to doing this work, but I think in the future if I choose this specialty as my main one, then I will not have problems with time

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
The main learning resource was practical exercises, thanks to which many issues were resolved very quickly. I also sometimes watched various videos on YouTube in order to further expand my understanding of this topic.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The biggest problem was in the KV file, because for some unknown reason, my boxes were constantly leaving somewhere, the text in them did not stand as I needed. But just by spending a little more time on it, all the problems were solved.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Of course, the classes made it easier to write code. This is a useful experience necessary for further work, because it is one of the most important parts of programming.
